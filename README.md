<h1>FotoFinder 2019</h1>
<h2>Bridgett Coyle</h2>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>The goal of this particular project was to create a functional photo album app using localStorage and DOM. Not only was this a solo project  </p>
<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
<p>Solidify and demonstrate your use of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>semantic HTML</li>
  <li>clean and organized CSS styles</li>
  <li>DRY Javascript</li>
  <li>localStorage to persist data</li>
  <li>Iterate through/filter dom elements using for loops/array prototype methods</li>
  <liUnderstand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOMli>
  <li>Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX</li>

<h3>Personal Insight</h3>
<p>This project was very challenging in the multiple different aspects it had us try to implement. Not only were we stretching our CSS and HTML muscles but we also had to implement localStorage and client facing DOM that was functional, clean, and persisting. Since this was a solo project, I now became the driver, navigator, and sounding board for my successes, failures, and learning moments. While I'm getting much better at writing Javascript, I feel I have more room for growth and getting comfortable with it.
